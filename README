QUICK START GUIDE:

    perl-ldap uses the following modules/distributions.

	MIME::Base64      - required, core module since Perl 5.7.3
	Convert::ASN1     - required
	IO::Socket::SSL   - optional, for LDAPS / start_tls support
	IO::Socket::INET6 - optional, for IPv6 support
	IO::Socket::IP    - optional, for IPv6 support
	Authen::SASL      - optional, for SASL authentication
	Digest::MD5       - optional, for SASL DIGEST-MD5 mechanism
	GSSAPI            - optional, for SASL GSSAPI mechanism
	URI::ldap         - optional, for URL parsing
	XML::SAX::Writer  - optional, for Net::LDAP::DSML
	Time::Local       - optional, for Net::LDAP::Util's time conversion functions

    If IO::Socket::IP 0.20 or higher is installed, it is dynamically (at runtime)
    preferred over IO::Socket::INET6.

    First ensure the above modules/distributions are installed then
    build/test/install Net::LDAP by doing

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

    Several modules in the distribution contain documentation. Once installed
    you can use the 'perldoc Net::LDAP' command to obtain the documentation.
    This documentation will contain pointers to the other modules.


*******************************************************************************
NOTE: Everything that has been deprecated will be removed when V1.00 is
released, but who knows when that will be.
